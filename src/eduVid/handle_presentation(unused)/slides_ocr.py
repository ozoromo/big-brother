    This class performs Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on 
    each extracted slide using Tesseract OCR. Tesseract is a popular OCR 
    engine. The recognized text from each slide is saved in an output text file.

    Usage:
    ```python
    # execute OCR
    slide_ocr_ = SlideOCR(tesseract_path, slides_folder, ocr_file)
    slide_ocr_.ocr_text_from_slides()
